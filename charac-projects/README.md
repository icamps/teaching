## Intermolecular forces

[Lab Notes](Intermolecular-Forces.pdf)

The aim of this project is for the student to investigate the intermolecular forces behind many physical and biological phenomena, such as DNA molecular recognition and protein folding.

### Part A: Thermodynamics of the hydrogen bonds in the formic acid dimer

Determine the enthalpy of dimerisation of formic acid by spectroscopic measurement, thereby determining the strength of the hydrogen bonds between the formic acid monomers.

[Measured infrared spectra of formic acid](Intermolecular-Forces/) *(Data are in spreadsheet .asc files)*

### Part B1: Computational investigation of hydrogen bonding

Run quantum electronic structure theory calculations using the Q-Chem electronic structure program. You will use an interface called IQmol to help write the input files and visualise the output. IQmol will also submit your jobs to be calculated and manage the resulting output files.

### Part B2: Independent investigation of some aspect of hydrogen bonding

Design and implement further investigations into the nature of hydrogen bonding.
